              <p className='text-slate-900 mb-6'>
                My name is Andualem, and I created Shalom Ethiopia Tours to
                build a community centered around love and family. I hope to
                welcome guests into my home country and connect them with
                Ethiopiaâ€™s rich and diverse culture while building long lasting
                friendships. Shalom is the Hebrew word for peace and welfare,
                qualities I wish to cultivate between the locals and visitors
                that join me on my adventures throughout the land.
              </p>
              <p>I look forward to welcoming you to Ethiopia!</p>
              <p>Shalom and love, Andy</p>

            Overview of our trips
          </h2>
          <p className='mb-6'>
            All tours are tailor-made, planned based on the duration of your
            trip and desired destinations. Most scheduled trips are between 5
            and 30 days, and span across one to multiple regions of Ethiopia.
            For example, you may book a 7 day trip only to Omo Valley to see the
            tribes. Alternatively, you can book a 2 week trip covering the
            North, South and Omo Valley. High season is during the Western
            holidays, between mid-December to end of February. The rest of the
            year is considerably less busier and allows for flexibility in
            lodging.
