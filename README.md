# Shalom Ethiopia Website

This website was created for Andy, a tour operator in Ethiopia.

## Backstory

In June 2018, my mother and aunt treated me to a special three week trip in Ethiopia as a gift for graduating college. Needless to say, the trip was surreal and humbling. Our private guide, Andy, and his driver took us all across the country and organized many intimate encounters with the native people. Andy and I bonded, and in the last week of the trip I asked him about his work. "So tell me... How do you source clients? Do you have a website or any digital presence?"

At the time, he was working in conjunction with other agencies and sharing the profits while getting referrals mostly from past clients. He shared with me his dream to open up his own business one day and call it Shalom Ethiopia Tours, hoping to provide a better life for himself and his family. "How long would it take you to set everything up?" He spoke of two years, perhaps more. By the end of our trip, the country and its people left such a strong impression on me that I couldn't leave without giving something back. I decided to help him. "Let's stay in touch. I will build your digital presence".

This website is the end result, which Andy used to market his services and collect booking requests.
